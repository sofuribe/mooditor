Today, I worked on:

- Creating a table for activities model.

Had to do some research on how to use ENUM with SQL. Added a new migrations file for the
activities table. Had to create a type as ENUM so all activities have their own value.
The table then consist of an id, entries_id (from entries table), and the name of activities.
Was able to complete the table, create a merge request, and push my branch into the main branch
after testing the table with Beekeeper ensuring it was working properly.

- Queries and Routers

Sofia and I collaborated on pair programming to develop the query and router functionalities for
the "entries" feature. I created base models for the endpoint and implemented a "create" function for
the entry endpoint. In the router file, I defined a function to handle the POST method for creating entries.
The endpoint was tested on Swagger and is fully functional.
