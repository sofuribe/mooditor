## March 28th:
Worked as a group on docker yaml file & connected database to Beekeeper Studio.

## March 29th:
I got my entries table along with the enum type migrated and into main. The table was also rendered on Beekeeper studio.

## March 30th:
Pair programmed with our group on authenication files. The login, logout, and signup endpoints all work.

## April 3rd:
Pair programmed with Terence on entry endpoints. Also worked as a group to fix bugs in create goals endpoint.

## April 4th:
Continued to pair program with Terence on entry endpoints. We got assistance from Rosheen and were able to get our POST goal endpoint to work. Had to change our entries table around. We are not using the activities table anymore, just using a list.

## April 5th:
Continued to pair program with Terence on entry endpoints. Most of our endpoints are working now, but not sure if it is the best way to access our data. One entry now has multiple rows if the user chooses more than one acivity (which also means multiple ids) so grabbing one entry or updating one entry is the challenge. Going to work on clarifying this tomorrow.

## April 6th:
Ran into issues with entry endpoints so we moved onto front-end auth for now. We got login and sign up to work.:

Was able to get the logged in/logged out view to work. I had to change the conditional I had.

## April 18th
As a group we worked on starting deployment and got to part 3. I also finished up my entries list component. I got a search feature up as well the mood to show up on the side of the entry date. Most of the functionility is up, I believe we still need an update button.
