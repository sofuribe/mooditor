## March 28th:
Worked as a group on docker yaml file & connected database to Beekeeper Studio.

## March 29th:
I got my entries table along with the enum type migrated and into main. The table was also rendered on Beekeeper Studio.

## March 30th:
Pair programmed with our group on authentication files. The login, logout, and signup endpoints all work.

## April 3rd:
Pair programmed with Terence on entry endpoints. Also worked as a group to fix bugs in create goals endpoint.

## April 4th:
Continued to pair program with Terence on entry endpoints. We got assistance from Rosheen and were able to get our POST goal endpoint to work. Had to change our entries table around. We are not using the activities table anymore, just using a list.

## April 5th:
Continued to pair program with Terence on entry endpoints. Most of our endpoints are working now, but not sure if it is the best way to access our data. One entry now has multiple rows if the user chooses more than one activity (which also means multiple ids) so grabbing one entry or updating one entry is the challenge. Going to work on clarifying this tomorrow.

## April 7th:
Ran into issues with entry endpoints so we moved onto front-end auth for now. We got login and sign up to work.

## April 11th
Watched some Tailwind CSS videos, got that installed, and started working on the navigation bar. Wasn't able to get the logged-in/logged-out view, but the links to signup and login work.

## April 12th
Was able to get the logged in/logged out view to work. I had to change the conditional I had.

## April 16th
Wrapped up basic landing page styling, going to get input from the team once we get back from spring break.

## April 17th
Started working on the entries list component, ran into some issues, and need to get a search feature up.

## April 18th
As a group, we worked on starting deployment and got to part 3. I also finished up my entries list component. I got a search feature up as well the mood to show up on the side of the entry date. Most of the functionality is up, I believe we still need an update button.

## April 19th
I worked on the home page component and got the calendar component up as well as the welcome "user" up. As a group, we worked on finishing up deployment.

## April 20th
Today we continued to work on deployment as a group. James had to come in and help us fix some of our code and Caprover stuff. We also worked on the entry list form as a group.

## April 21st
Continued to work more on styling the main page and home page. I am trying to see what theme looks best for our application. I am feeling more comfortable using Tailwind.

## April 24th
We took the practice test in the morning and in the afternoon I just worked on small changes around our site as well as worked on more components with the team.

## April 25th
Worked on the home page a lot (styling, placement, importing the components). Ran into some issues with Tailwind but was able to get them fixed.

## April 26th
We ran into some Caprover issues so we worked on fixing those for a good chunk of the day. Aside from that, I worked on styling the entry form to be more user-friendly.

## April 27th:
I worked on styling the goal forms and lists and fixing little bugs before presenting. After that, we did a demo for Rosheen! Everything went well and am proud of how the app came out.
